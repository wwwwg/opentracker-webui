# Opentracker WebUI

It’s a minimalist responsive web interface for [Opentracker](https://erdgeist.org/arts/software/opentracker/) BitTorrent tracker that you can use from your router (provided it’s got PHP installed).

Example NGINX configuration can be found [here](https://github.com/garnetius/opentracker-webui/blob/master/nginx.conf).
